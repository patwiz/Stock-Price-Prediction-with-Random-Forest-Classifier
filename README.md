# Stock Price Prediction with Random Forest Classifier

## Purpose
This code aims to predict the direction of stock price movements using historical data and a Random Forest Classifier. The prediction is based on features such as closing price, volume, open price, high, and low. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can help make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks.

## Libraries Used
- **yfinance**: Used for fetching historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, creating and handling data frames.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the Random Forest Classifier model and evaluating its performance.

## Code Explanation
### Fetching Stock Data
1. The code starts by installing the required libraries and importing them.
2. It then fetches historical S&P 500 data using the `yfinance` library.

### Data Preprocessing
1. The historical data is processed to remove unnecessary columns such as dividends and stock splits.
2. A new column "Tomorrow" is created, representing the closing price of the next day.
3. A binary "Target" column is created based on whether the next day's closing price is higher than the current day's closing price.

### Model Training
1. The Random Forest Classifier model is created with specified parameters.
2. The data is split into training and testing sets.
3. The model is trained on the training set using the specified predictors.

### Model Evaluation
1. The model's predictions are obtained for the test set.
2. Precision score is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
3. The predictions and actual values are plotted for visual inspection.

### Backtesting
1. Functions `predict` and `backtest` are defined to perform backtesting on the entire dataset.
2. Backtesting is done to evaluate the model's performance over different time periods.

### Feature Engineering
1. Additional features are created based on rolling averages, close ratios, and trend indicators.
2. The dataset is updated after adding new features.

### Model Update and Reevaluation
1. The Random Forest Classifier model is updated with new predictors.
2. Predictions are again obtained, and backtesting is performed to evaluate the updated model.

### Results Analysis
1. The results of the backtesting, including prediction counts, precision score, and target distribution, are presented.

### Conclusion
1. The code concludes with further analysis or comments.
